# Supervisor Writing Style Synthesis

This document synthesizes the writing style patterns observed in two papers co-authored by the supervisors (Niklas Kühl appears in both):

1. **Allmendinger et al. (2025)** - "Multi-Agent AI: A New Paradigm for Knowledge Work Automation"
2. **Deck et al. (2024)** - "A Critical Survey on Fairness Benefits of XAI"

## Core Structural Patterns

### 1. Framework-Driven Organization

**Allmendinger et al. approach:**
- Introduces comprehensive frameworks with clear component decomposition (5-component MAAI architecture)
- Each component receives dedicated treatment with definition, purpose, and interconnections
- Frameworks progress from high-level conceptual to implementation-level details
- Visual representations (diagrams, flowcharts) anchor conceptual discussions

**Deck et al. approach:**
- Systematic categorization through archetypal patterns (7 archetypal claims)
- Multi-dimensional analytical frameworks (5 fairness dimensions × 7 claims)
- Explicit methodological frameworks (PRISMA, grounded theory)
- Structured critique organized by archetypal categories

**Synthesis for thesis writing:**
- Organize complex concepts through multi-layered frameworks
- Decompose systems into clear, enumerated components
- Map relationships between components explicitly
- Support frameworks with visual representations

### 2. Introduction and Motivation Strategy

**Common patterns:**
- Begin with concrete, relatable scenarios that illustrate the problem space
- Allmendinger: "Imagine a novice investor..." (motivating scenario)
- Deck: Concrete examples of fairness-XAI claims in literature
- Move from specific examples to general principles
- Establish both practical relevance and theoretical gaps

**Language patterns:**
- "Despite the..., there remains..." (establishing gap)
- "While X has received attention, Y remains underexplored"
- Concrete → Abstract → Framework structure

### 3. Critical and Analytical Voice

**Deck et al. exemplifies:**
- Direct critical assessment: "vague and simplistic", "lacking normative grounding", "poorly aligned"
- Evidence-based critique with specific citations
- Identifies both strengths and limitations systematically
- Acknowledges complexity: "nuanced relationship", "multifaceted concept"
- Avoids overstatement; includes caveats and boundary conditions

**Language markers:**
- "However, we argue that..."
- "A critical examination reveals..."
- "While claim X suggests Y, evidence indicates..."
- "This relationship is more nuanced than..."

### 4. Definitional Precision

**Allmendinger approach:**
- Boxed definitions for key concepts
- Clear boundary setting for new terms (MAAI vs single-agent systems)
- Explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria

**Deck approach:**
- Operational definitions grounded in literature
- Multi-dimensional concept decomposition (fairness across 5 dimensions)
- Acknowledges definitional tensions and competing frameworks

**Application:**
- Define core terms early with precision
- Acknowledge when definitions are contested
- Provide operational definitions for empirical work
- Use formal definitional structures (boxes, dedicated subsections)

## Methodological Presentation

### 1. Systematic and Transparent Methods

**Deck et al. standards:**
- Explicit methodology section with procedural detail
- PRISMA flowcharts for literature reviews
- Clear inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Reproducible search strategies
- Grounded theory for qualitative analysis
- Quantitative reporting (175 papers analyzed, publication year distributions)

**Best practices:**
- Make all methodological choices explicit
- Justify selection criteria
- Report sample characteristics quantitatively
- Use established methodological frameworks (PRISMA, etc.)
- Include limitations subsection

### 2. Hypothesis and Research Question Formulation

**Patterns observed:**
- Research questions derived from identified gaps
- Hypotheses stated clearly and testably
- Connection between literature gaps and research design
- Multiple research pathways or questions organized systematically

**Structure:**
- Background → Gap → Research Question → Hypothesis/Method
- Number and organize multiple hypotheses (H1, H2, etc.)

## Argumentation and Evidence

### 1. Evidence-Based Claims

**Common standards:**
- Every major claim supported by citations
- Multiple sources for controversial claims
- Recent literature prioritized (both papers from 2024-2025)
- Mix of seminal works and cutting-edge research

**Citation density:**
- High citation frequency (Deck: 175+ references for ~20-page paper)
- Integrated citations, not isolated
- Citations used to build arguments, not just support

### 2. Logical Structure

**Typical argument flow:**
1. Establish current understanding (with citations)
2. Identify limitation or gap
3. Introduce alternative perspective or framework
4. Support with evidence
5. Acknowledge complexity or boundaries
6. Propose way forward

### 3. Handling Complexity and Nuance

**Key practices:**
- Avoid binary framings; acknowledge spectrums
- "Not only X, but also Y"
- Explicit treatment of edge cases
- Limitations sections that genuinely engage with constraints
- Future work that emerges from current limitations

## Language and Tone

### 1. Academic Register

**Characteristics:**
- Formal without being stilted
- Technical precision in terminology
- Avoids colloquialisms
- Present tense for general claims; past tense for specific studies
- Active voice where appropriate; passive for methods

**Avoid:**
- Casual language ("really important", "super effective")
- Vague intensifiers without evidence ("clearly", "obviously")
- Rhetorical questions (rare in both papers)

### 2. Precision in Claims

**Observed patterns:**
- Qualified statements: "suggests that", "indicates", "appears to"
- Strength calibrated to evidence: "demonstrates" vs "hints at"
- Explicit about uncertainty: "remains unclear", "requires further investigation"
- Distinguishes empirical findings from interpretations

### 3. Structural Signposting

**Common devices:**
- "First..., Second..., Third..." for enumerations
- "However", "Nevertheless", "Moreover" for logical transitions
- "In contrast", "Similarly" for comparisons
- "Specifically", "In particular" for elaboration
- Section previews: "We organize this discussion in three parts..."

## Visual and Organizational Elements

### 1. Tables

**Deck et al. usage:**
- Summary tables for complex categorizations
- Mapping tables (claims × dimensions)
- Comparison tables (approaches, definitions, findings)
- Tables complement rather than repeat text

**Best practices:**
- Clear headers and row labels
- Footnotes for additional context
- Referenced explicitly in text
- Professional formatting (booktabs style)

### 2. Figures and Diagrams

**Allmendinger usage:**
- Architectural diagrams for system components
- Flowcharts for processes
- Visual frameworks that anchor discussion

**Standards:**
- High-quality, professional appearance
- Clear labels and legends
- Self-contained captions
- Progressive detail (overview → detailed views)

### 3. Section Organization

**Common patterns:**
- Logical progression from general to specific
- Parallel structure in subsections
- Clear hierarchy (Section → Subsection → Subsubsection)
- Balanced section lengths (avoid very short sections)

## Specific Stylistic Preferences

### 1. Terminology Consistency

- Define key terms once, use consistently
- Acronyms: define on first use, then use acronym
- Avoid synonym variation for technical terms

### 2. Sentence Structure

- Mix of sentence lengths for readability
- Complex ideas in compound sentences with clear subordination
- Topic sentences that forecast paragraph content
- Final sentences that transition or synthesize

### 3. Paragraph Construction

- Unity: one main idea per paragraph
- Coherence: logical flow between sentences
- Length: typically 4-8 sentences
- Opening sentence establishes topic; closing sentence provides transition or emphasis

## Application Recommendations for Thesis Revision

## Examples of Preferred Phrasings

**Instead of:** "This is important"
**Use:** "This relationship has significant implications for..."

**Instead of:** "We will show that..."
**Use:** "Evidence suggests that..." or "Analysis reveals that..."

**Instead of:** "Obviously, X affects Y"
**Use:** "Prior research demonstrates that X influences Y [citations]"

**Instead of:** "Our experiment is good"
**Use:** "The experimental design addresses limitations in prior work by..."

**Instead of:** "The results are interesting"
**Use:** "The results reveal unexpected patterns in..." or "These findings suggest..."

## Summary: Core Principles

3. **Methodological Transparency**: Make all choices explicit and justified
4. **Evidence-Based**: High citation density; calibrate claims to evidence
5. **Precision**: Technical accuracy in terminology and qualified claims
